		<p>People have long believed that salt-affected land was unusable. But as a result of in-depth research and years of testing, a practical solution was found: Saline agriculture.<br/><br/><br/><span class="abc">It is very well possible to grow crops on salt-affected land, as long as the right (salt tolerant) crops are being used, combined with alternative techniques in irrigation, fertilization and water management. With saline agriculture, food is produced on salt-affected soils and salt or brackish water is used for irrigation.</span>
		</p>
		<p><span class="bcd">Freshwater is a (very) limited resource in the world. </span>Most of the water available for irrigation comes from aquifers (groundwater) and lakes. The total amount of fresh water from these two resources only accounts for less than 1% of the total water supply. Traditional farming techniques use fresh water for irrigation, putting a heavy demand on the world’s already scarce fresh water supplies.  In fact, of all the water in the world, only 1% is fresh water, of which 70% is used for agriculture! In the table below, it is shown that the amount of saline water is almost equal to the amount of fresh water in both lakes as well as aquifers
		</p>
		<p>If all of the world’s saline water would be used for irrigation, it could double the amount of available water for agriculture. At the same time, saline agriculture limits the damage caused by salinization by employing sustainable practices for agriculture and water management, and by making use of salt-tolerant crop varieties.</p>
